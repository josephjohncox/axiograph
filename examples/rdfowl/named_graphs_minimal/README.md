# RDF Named Graphs (Contexts) — Minimal Fixture

This folder is a tiny **TriG** dataset intended to exercise:

- **named graphs** → Axiograph **contexts/worlds**
- open-world modeling (“missing is unknown, not false”)
- schema discovery + draft `.axi` generation from `proposals.json`

Run the deterministic demo:

```bash
./scripts/rdf_named_graph_context_demo.sh
```
